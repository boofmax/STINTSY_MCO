    "Soccer's extraordinary global appeal, with 3.5 billion supporters worldwide, cements its position as the most watched sport on the planet. Soccer creates a common passion that brings people from all walks of life together (The Most Popular Sports In The World, n.d.). This worldwide sport has the remarkable potential to cross cultural, language, and geographical borders, bringing people together from all walks of life. Fans congregate in their homes, bars, or stadiums to form a feeling of community and shared identity. Soccer's ongoing popularity stems from its capacity to bring together people of all ages and skill levels, making it more than simply a game but a celebration of athleticism, teamwork, and the universal spirit of competitiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soccer's enormous commercial worth is clear in the huge sums it earns for numerous leagues throughout the world. Soccer leagues have the highest TV viewership of any sports league, which contributes greatly to the sport's economic supremacy. The World Cup, the flagship event, is the embodiment of this phenomena, easily outshining every other significant athletic event. The tremendous viewership and worldwide influence of the World Cup highlight soccer's power to captivate the collective interest and intrigue of audiences on an unprecedented scale, transforming it into more than simply a game but a global cultural phenomenon. Soccer's economic impact, paired with its exciting dynamics, solidifies it as a sporting superpower that crosses geographical and cultural barriers (The World’s Most Watched Sports, 2017)."

    "Home advantage, which occurs in all sports, including soccer, is caused by a mix of psychological and physiological variables. The presence of ardent supporters fosters a supportive and motivational environment for the home side while perhaps influencing referee decisions owing to crowd reactions. Furthermore, the physical and emotional exhaustion involved with travel for visiting teams contributes to the home edge. The familiarity with the particular qualities of the home field, like as pitch size and surface, further tilts the scale in favor of the home side. Home advantage is essentially a complicated interaction of crowd support, referee dynamics, travel-related obstacles, and field familiarity that shapes the competitive landscape of sports (Zheng, 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, our objective is to investigate the feasibility of forecasting home advantage based on a snapshot of soccer matches. This project intends to emphasize the complex problems of applying modeling tools to real-life events, particularly in the dynamic environment of soccer matches. These machine learning models can help teams plan better strategies by offering insights into their opponents' strengths and weaknesses, such as knowing whether it is strategically better to play aggressively given the statistics of the match. Fans may also appreciate the game on a whole new level through the analysis of data and understanding the aspects that contribute to a team's success. Furthermore, predictive models can assist spectators in making better educated predictions about the outcome of a game, which can increase the enjoyment of watching the game."

    "K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is a simple and effective algorithm for classification. KNN predicts the label of a new data point by locating the K-nearest neighbors to a given data point and utilizing their labels. KNN is an excellent choice for this assignment since it can manage non-linear correlations between predictor and outcome variables. Furthermore, KNN is a basic algorithm that is straightforward to build and comprehend. To achieve the best results, it is critical to select an acceptable value of K and distance measure (LaViale, 2023)."

    "For KNN, after fine-tuning the hyperparameters, the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) model exhibited a marginal improvement in accuracy. Despite this modification, it is not recommended to use this model on the current dataset. The observed performance may be due to the complexity and abundance of characteristics in the dataset. To improve the efficiency and speed of the KNN method, the dimensionality of the data must be reduced. Dimensionality can make distances between data points less distinct, increasing model complexity and decreasing efficacy."

    "For Random Forest, despite being designed to mitigate overfitting, both the default hyperparameter configuration and the model fine-tuned with the best-found hyperparameters still demonstrate overfitting tendencies, as shown by relatively lower prediction accuracy on the test set compared to the training set. To address this, an examination of feature importances revealed that certain features may not significantly contribute to the model's performance. Consequently, a potential enhancement involves considering the removal of features with limited influence. Moreover, the process of hyperparameter tuning involved extensive trial and error within the search space, yielding only marginal improvements. To refine this approach, further exploration of hyperparameter combinations, such as the inclusion of parameters like max depth, could be undertaken to achieve more substantial enhancements in model accuracy."

    "In summary, the logistic regression model, outperforms the other two models, achieving an accuracy of 78.50% on the test set. The model demonstrates a well-balanced precision and recall across classes, with particularly robust discrimination between instances of \"Home Advantage\" and \"Away Advantage.\" This enhanced performance can be attributed to the exclusion of snapshots categorized as \"Balanced,\" where home and away scores are equal."
